## Summary

Implemented source scope by tagging sources and scoping by source tags. This allows for grouping of multiple
sources together, and including one source in multiple groups. Tags are superior to files.

## Notes

- Slow and steady I guess :)
- Business model is to provide private sources, enterprise indexes, and content creation.
