## Summary

Today I did my second favorite thing after coding. Deleting code. After spending yesterday evening and this morning
attempting to solve the Ranking algorithm I have opted to take a step back and continue building. It turns out the built
in Postgresql full text search is faster, returns better results, and is far simpler than what I had implemented, so
while glad I did it to learn im also glad to have deleted it in favor of PG. Certainly I'll need to switch it to
something like Elastic search either way so better to be quick with the mvp. I'll just focus on creating a great personal experience
for now. Something is still off with importing some of the links

## Models

## View

## Controller

## Notes

- Use association helpe functions! Because I created all manipulation of hydration through the page it is trivial
to merge hydration with page.
